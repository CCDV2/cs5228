# CS5228

#### Dependencies

```shell
pip install kaggle
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install category_encoders
```

## Usage
Apart from notebook tasks, others are organized modulely. You could reference `config.yaml` and run `main.py` to call each task subsequentially, and modify any parameter from the config file.    

To run `main.py` for demo, please download [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs5228-2021-semester-1-final-project/data) and put them in `./data`. Then you could see data preprocess and predict task, and `predict.csv` will be generated under `./data`.
